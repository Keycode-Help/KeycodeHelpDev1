# Tech Stack with Detailed Instructions

## Backend (Serverless)
With the serverless approach, Firebase handles backend requirements, minimizing traditional server management needs. Below are the key backend technologies and configurations.

### 1. Firebase Functions – Serverless Backend
**Why**: Firebase Functions provide a serverless environment for handling API requests, business logic, and secure interactions with Firebase services.

**Instructions**:
- Set up Firebase Functions:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    firebase init functions
    ```
- Use Firebase Functions to handle API requests for services such as:
  - VIN to Keycode lookups
  - User authentication checks
  - Logging user actions and requests
- Use Firebase Console to set up environment configurations and ensure proper permissions are set for accessing Firestore and other Firebase services.

### 2. Firebase Firestore – Real-Time Database
**Why**: Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL database that supports real-time data synchronization.

**Instructions**:
- Configure Firestore in Firebase Console and set up collections for:
  - `VINLookups`: Stores VIN, keycode, and user details for each request.
  - `KeyTypeDetails`: Stores keycode, key type, transponder chip details, frequency, and programming steps.
  - `Users`: Manages user roles and permissions (e.g., locksmith, admin).
- Define Firestore rules to enforce security, ensuring only authenticated users access data based on their role.

### 3. Firebase Authentication – Secure User Management
**Why**: Firebase Authentication simplifies managing user login, registration, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

**Instructions**:
- Enable Email/Password Authentication in Firebase Console.
- Set up MFA for additional security.
- Use Firebase's role-based access to restrict endpoints, ensuring locksmiths and admins have the appropriate access levels.

### 4. Stripe Integration – Payment Processing
**Why**: Stripe handles payment processing, subscription management, and invoicing with robust security.

**Instructions**:
- Set up a Stripe account and configure webhooks for events like `invoice.payment_succeeded` and `invoice.payment_failed`.
- Use Firebase's Stripe extension to streamline integration, allowing secure, serverless subscription management directly in Firebase Functions.

## Frontend

### 1. Next.js (React) – Frontend Framework
**Why**: Next.js enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and excellent performance for a real-time, responsive application.

**Instructions**:
- Set up a new Next.js project:
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest keycode-help-frontend
    cd keycode-help-frontend
    ```
- Configure API routes for client-side communication with Firebase Functions (e.g., `/api/vinLookup`, `/api/keyType`).
- Use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` for optimal data loading strategies in Next.js pages.

### 2. TypeScript – Type Safety
**Why**: TypeScript introduces static typing, enhancing maintainability and code quality, particularly in a large codebase with complex data types.

**Instructions**:
- Set up TypeScript in your Next.js project:
    ```bash
    touch tsconfig.json
    npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
    ```
- Define interfaces for API responses, keycode data, and user roles to ensure consistency across components.

### 3. Tailwind CSS – Styling Framework
**Why**: Tailwind CSS speeds up development with utility-first classes, making it easy to create responsive and modern UIs without custom CSS.

**Instructions**:
- Install and configure Tailwind in your Next.js project:
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
    npx tailwindcss init
    ```
- Use utility classes to style forms, buttons, dashboards, and mobile-friendly components quickly.

## Real-Time Data & Notifications

### 1. Firestore Real-Time Updates
**Why**: Firestore’s real-time sync provides instant data updates, ideal for displaying dynamic information (e.g., VIN lookup results, keycode status).

**Instructions**:
- Use Firestore’s real-time listeners in the frontend to subscribe to updates:
    ```javascript
    import { firestore } from '../firebaseConfig';
    firestore.collection('VINLookups').onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
      // Handle real-time updates
    });
    ```

### 2. Firebase Cloud Messaging (Optional) – Notifications
**Why**: Cloud Messaging allows real-time push notifications, useful for sending alerts about subscription renewals or low credits.

**Instructions**:
- Enable Cloud Messaging in Firebase Console.
- Set up notification permissions on the client-side, and use Firebase Functions to trigger notifications based on user activity or specific events.

---

## Automation Tools (Optional)

### 1. Puppeteer (Web Scraping) – Automate VIN-to-Keycode Process
**Why**: Puppeteer can be used to automate VIN-to-keycode retrieval if a dedicated API is unavailable.

**Instructions**:
- Set up Puppeteer in a Firebase Function:
    ```bash
    npm install puppeteer
    ```
- Write a script to interact with the VIN retrieval service, retrieve keycodes, and store them in Firestore.

### 2. Nodemailer – Automated Email Notifications
**Why**: Notify users automatically after completing a VIN-to-keycode request or when updates are available.

**Instructions**:
- Install Nodemailer in Firebase Functions:
    ```bash
    npm install nodemailer
    ```
- Configure an SMTP service and create email templates to send keycode retrieval or subscription updates directly to users.

---

## CI/CD & DevOps

### 1. Vercel – CI/CD and Hosting
**Why**: Vercel provides serverless deployment, automatic scaling, and continuous deployment for Next.js projects, making it ideal for this setup.

**Instructions**:
- Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automated deployments.
- Configure environment variables in Vercel for Firebase and Stripe keys.
- Push changes to the main branch to trigger automatic deployments on Vercel.

### 2. GitHub Actions – CI/CD for Testing
**Why**: GitHub Actions automate testing, building, and deploying whenever new code is pushed, ensuring reliability.

**Instructions**:
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
    ```yaml
    name: CI Pipeline
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '14'
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
          - name: Run tests
            run: npm run test
    ```
