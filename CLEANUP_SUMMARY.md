# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed
1. **kch-frontend/src/pages/About.jsx** - Duplicate of AboutUs.jsx, not imported anywhere
2. **kch-frontend/src/test-supabase.js** - Unused test file
3. **kch-frontend/src/pages/KchDatabase.test.jsx** - Unused test file
4. **frontend_integration.ts** - Unused template file in root
5. **KeycodeHelpDev1-Backend** - Empty file
6. **Logs** - Empty file
7. **render.yaml** - Empty file
8. **kch-frontend/update-admin-account.sql** - Empty file

## Dependencies Removed from package.json
1. **@mui/material** - Not used anywhere in the codebase
2. **dotenv** - Not needed in frontend (Vite handles env vars)
3. **bcryptjs** - Not used in frontend (should be backend only)

## Code Improvements
1. **Fixed duplicate Shield import** in LoggedInHomepage.jsx
2. **Added missing loader icon** to IconProvider.jsx for TrialBanner component
3. **Optimized AuthContext.jsx**:
   - Removed redundant backend calls during initialization
   - Made backend verification non-blocking for better performance
   - Fixed localStorage auth restoration to work offline
   - Removed unused code blocks and comments

## Performance Improvements
1. **Added VITE_BACKEND_URL** to .env file for proper backend configuration
2. **Optimized auth initialization**:
   - Auth now restores immediately from localStorage
   - Backend verification happens asynchronously in background
   - Reduced initial load time by avoiding blocking API calls
   - Better error handling for 500 errors (keeps local state)

## Auth Issue Resolution
The auth restoration from localStorage is intentional and correct. The improvements made:
- Auth state loads immediately from localStorage for faster initial render
- Backend verification happens in background (non-blocking)
- Better handling of backend errors (500 errors don't clear local auth)
- Only 401 errors will clear the auth state
- Added offline support - app works even when backend is down

## Recommendations for Further Optimization
1. Consider implementing code splitting for large pages
2. Add lazy loading for routes not immediately needed
3. Consider removing @tanstack/react-query if not actively used
4. Implement proper error boundaries for better error handling
5. Add service worker for offline functionality
6. Consider using a CDN for static assets
