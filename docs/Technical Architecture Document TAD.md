# Keycode Help: Technical Architecture Document (TAD)

## Project Overview
Keycode Help is a SaaS platform providing automotive locksmith services, converting Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) into key codes for automotive professionals. Target users include locksmiths, automotive repair shops, and tow truck operators, offering emergency keycode services and regular access to resources like guides and support.  
This document outlines the architecture, technical requirements, and guidelines for the Keycode Help web application, designed to facilitate collaboration between frontend and backend developers, DevOps, and business stakeholders.

## 1. Project Scope
The scope of this project is to build a web application that provides automotive professionals with on-demand access to keycodes. Core features include user authentication, VIN-to-keycode service, subscription models, real-time updates, and secure payment processing.

**Core Features**:
- **VIN to Key Code Conversion Service**: Users enter a VIN to retrieve the corresponding key code.
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, role-based access, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Subscription Management**: Implement various membership tiers (e.g., free, basic, premium) with different feature access.
- **Real-Time Data**: Firebase Firestore manages real-time data like user activity logs.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for payments and subscription management.
- **Security**: Firebase Authentication for role-based access control.
- **24/7 Emergency Access**: Priority access to emergency services for premium users.
- **Analytics and Monitoring**: Track user activity and system logs using Firebase Analytics.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1. Frontend Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js  
  *Why*: Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), delivering fast load times and SEO optimization.
- **State Management**: React Context API or React Query for server state caching and fetching.
- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI (MUI) for responsive, accessible design.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for flexible, utility-first styling.
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with built-in MFA.
- **Deployment**: Vercel, for efficient CI/CD, auto-scaling, and rollback capabilities.

### 2.2. Backend Requirements
- **Backend Logic and API**: Managed through Next.js API routes and Firebase Functions.  
  *Why*: Simplifies backend operations by consolidating into a single environment with Firebase support, reducing complexity.
- **Database**:
  - **Primary DB**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data, user profiles, subscriptions, and transaction logging.
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe  
  *Why*: Stripe enables seamless payment and subscription management with easy integration and high security.

### 2.3. Cloud Hosting and Infrastructure
- **Hosting Provider**: Vercel  
  *Why*: Vercel provides a serverless environment optimized for Next.js and Firebase, ideal for streamlined deployments.
- **Real-Time Features**: Firestore for user action tracking, logs, and live updates.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployments.
- **Monitoring**: Firebase Analytics and Vercel monitoring for usage and performance insights.

## 3. Business Logic

### 3.1. User Registration and Authentication
- **Registration**: Users register with Firebase Authentication, using MFA for added security.
- **Role-Based Access**: Users are assigned roles (e.g., Locksmith, Admin), controlling service access based on their subscription tier.

### 3.2. VIN to Key Code Service
- **Keycode Lookup**: Users enter a VIN in the frontend.
- **Validation**: System verifies VIN format and checks subscription status for access.
- **Keycode Retrieval**: Firebase Functions handle keycode retrieval and respond to the frontend.
- **Logging**: Firestore logs each request, capturing details like user, VIN, and actions.

### 3.3. Subscription Management
- **Membership Tiers**:
  - **Free Tier**: Limited VIN lookups, no emergency support.
  - **Basic Tier**: Increased VIN lookups with limited support.
  - **Premium Tier**: Full access with 24/7 emergency services and priority support.
- **Billing**: Stripe handles billing, including subscription renewals and cancellations.

### 3.4. Real-Time Data Management
- **User Activity Tracking**: Firestore logs all actions, such as VIN lookups and keycode retrievals.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Firebase triggers notifications based on user behavior (e.g., subscription expiry).

### 3.5. Emergency Keycode Service
- **24/7 Access**: Premium users access keycodes in emergencies, including off-hours.
- **Queue System**: Prioritize emergency requests over standard lookups.

### 3.6. Payment Processing
- **Subscription Plans**: Users manage their memberships, handled by Stripe.
- **Billing History**: Stripe manages real-time updates for invoices and payment status.

## 5. Guidelines and Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Use GitHub with a GitFlow branching strategy.
- **Code Quality**: Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript linting.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement Jest for frontend and Firebase Functions testing.
- **Documentation**: Document modules in Markdown or similar tools. Use Postman or Swagger for API documentation.
- **Performance**: Optimize Firestore queries and cache frequently accessed data for responsiveness.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data and ensure secure authentication methods.
