## Accessing the Project Board

The **GitHub Project Board** is where we track tasks, goals, and the progress of all active items in the project. It’s organized into columns for each stage of development, including **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review**, and **Done**.

To access the Project Board:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Keycode-Help/KeycodeHelpDev1).
2. Click on the **Projects** tab at the top of the repository.
3. Select the active project board for Keycode Help to see all tasks and goals.

> **Tip**: Use the Project Board to stay updated on what tasks need attention, what’s currently being worked on, and what has been completed.

## Using the Discussion Board

To access the Discussion Board:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Keycode-Help/KeycodeHelpDev1).
2. Click on the **Discussions** tab at the top of the repository.

Feel free to contribute to existing discussions or start new topics if you have ideas, questions, or insights to share.
