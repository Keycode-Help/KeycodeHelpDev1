# Testing Guidelines

## 1. Unit Testing

### 1.1. Scope
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and components, such as VIN decoding or form validation.
- **Framework**: Use Jest for writing and executing JavaScript unit tests.

### 1.2. Coverage
- Ensure critical functions have unit tests, especially those that handle data manipulation and validations.

## 2. Integration Testing

### 2.1. Scope
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between frontend and backend services to ensure they function correctly together.
- **Tools**: Cypress for end-to-end testing of core workflows, including API calls and UI updates.

### 2.2. Coverage
- Focus on main flows like VIN lookups and keycode generation, ensuring that data is correctly sent and received.

## 3. Security Testing

### 3.1. Penetration Testing
- **Tools**: Use OWASP Zap for identifying common vulnerabilities and security flaws in the application.

### 3.2. Dependency Checks
- **Tools**: Use Snyk or npm audit to perform regular scans for security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## 4. Performance Testing

### 4.1. Load Testing
- **Tools**: Use Artillery or JMeter to test the application under load conditions, simulating peak usage.

### 4.2. Targets
- Ensure the application maintains acceptable response times under typical and peak loads, focusing on key features such as VIN lookups.

## 5. Bug Reporting

### 5.1. Procedure
- **Steps**: Log bugs with detailed descriptions, reproduction steps, environment details, and screenshots if applicable.

### 5.2. Tracking
- **Tool**: Use GitHub Issues to document, prioritize, and track bugs through to resolution.
