# Keycode Help Project Workflow

## Branch Structure Overview

The **Keycode Help** project follows a structured branching strategy to maintain code quality, testing, and deployment across environments. Hereâ€™s an overview of the three main branches:

- **`dev` branch**: Used for active development and integration of new features. All feature branches should be merged into `dev` after initial testing.
- **`main` branch**: Serves as the staging environment. This branch is considered stable and contains features ready for final testing before going live.
- **`production` branch**: Represents the live codebase. Only thoroughly tested and approved changes from the `main` branch should be merged here.
