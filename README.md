## üõ† Tech Stack
At **Keycode Help**, we are committed to delivering a robust and efficient solution. For the MVP, we‚Äôre focusing on simplicity, performance, and scalability with the following tech stack:

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express.js**: Lightweight, fast, and perfect for building REST API endpoints for VIN to Keycode services, authentication, and dashboard features.
- **MySQL**: A reliable relational database for structured data, storing user profiles, VINs, keycodes, and query history.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure, stateless authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For secure password hashing.

#### Alternatives to Express.js:
- **Fastify**: For performance-critical applications.
- **Koa.js**: For a minimal and modern alternative to Express.
- **NestJS**: If modular and scalable architecture is required in the future.

### Frontend
- **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**: A lightweight, flexible approach for building the initial MVP. Tailwind CSS ensures responsive and modern designs without writing custom styles from scratch.

### Additional Tools
- **Postman**: For API testing during backend development.
- **Nodemailer**: To send automated emails (e.g., user confirmations or VIN query results).
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines, including automated testing and deployments.
- **Stripe**: Secure payment processing and subscription management.

## Branch Roles

### Main (Stable Release Branch)
- Represents the stable, tested, and ready-for-release code.
- Used for production deployments.
- Only merge into `main` after thorough testing on the `production` branch.

### Dev (Active Development Branch)
- Serves as the integration branch for new features and fixes.
- Collaborators push changes (via feature branches) to `dev`.
- Regularly tested to ensure all changes are working as expected.

### Production (Pre-Release Testing Branch)
- Used to simulate the production environment and test the application.
- Changes are merged from `dev` into `production` for final testing before deploying to `main`.

## ü§ù Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions from developers! To contribute:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `git checkout -b feature-branch` 
    
3.  Commit your changes:
    
    bash

    `git push origin feature-branch` 
    
5.  Open a Pull Request on GitHub.

----------

## Workflow

### 1. Local Development (Feature Branches)

Developers create feature branches from `dev`:

bash

Copy code

`git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>` 

Work on the feature locally, stage, and commit changes:

bash

Copy code

`git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature <feature-name>"` 

Push the feature branch:

bash

Copy code

`git push origin feature/<feature-name>` 

### 2. Merge into Dev

-   Open a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into `dev`.
-   Perform code reviews, testing, and resolve conflicts before merging.

### 3. Testing in Production Branch

Once the `dev` branch is stable, merge it into `production`:

bash

Copy code

`git checkout production
git merge dev
git push origin production` 

Perform final tests in a pre-release environment.

### 4. Deploy to Main

After successful testing in `production`, merge changes into `main`:

bash

Copy code

`git checkout main
git merge production
git push origin main`
